# Conways Game Of Life

## Description

"The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine." -Wikipedia


## Motivation

Decided to create this simple program simply to practice and build upon some of my skills acquired during my first 2 years of learning programming.


## Features

**Drawing:** The user can draw the cells in order to create the original population. The user can also draw in a already running simulation and the program will react to it in real time.

**Randomise Population:** Randomises the initial population on the board.

**Start Simulation:** Starts the simulation based on the present cells on the board.

**Stop Iteration:** Stops the simulation in the present moment.

**Next Iteration:** After stopping the simulation, the user can press this button to skip one simulation at the time (each press).

**Resume Simulation:** After stopping the simulation, the user can resume the simulation by pressing this button.

**Reset:** Resets the program to the initial state.
